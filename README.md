# atom-cybernetic-style

A style sheet usable in [Atom Editor](http://atom.io)

* Adds animation to bracket matching
* Makes colors just that tad bit more intuitive (and brighter) for syntax highlighting
* Highly customizable!
* Self-contained.

I chose to do it this way since there are wierd under-documented rules to the way you make them as per Atom.io website.

To use:

Go to Settings > Themes

Set a dark theme for both syntax and UI

Click "Your stylesheet" link to modify the stylesheet in Atom.

Copy contents of stylesheet.css contained herein and paste into your stylesheet!  (Backup if replacing, or add to your existing one)

Paste into your Atom.io stylesheet!
