# atom-cybernetic-style

A style sheet usable in [Atom Editor](http://atom.io)

* Adds animation to bracket matching
* Makes colors just that tad bit more intuitive (and brighter) for syntax highlighting
* Highly customizable!
* Self-contained.

I chose to do it this way since there are wierd under-documented rules to the way you make syntax customizations as per Atom.io documentation / website.  After trying to do it I saw some odd behavior due to inheritance in less, so I just ended up copy/pasting it entirely into my stylesheet and here it is, for reuse.  I built this using City Lights and then experimented using Autumn.  Try using this to override settings for "Dark Themes" like those mentioned here.

To use:

1. Go to Settings > Themes
2. Set a dark theme for both syntax and UI
3. Click "Your stylesheet" link to modify the stylesheet in Atom.
4. Copy contents of stylesheet.css contained herein and paste into your stylesheet!  (Backup if replacing, or add to your existing one)
5. Paste into your Atom.io stylesheet!
